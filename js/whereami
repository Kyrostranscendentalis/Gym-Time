whereami?

goals
- trying to get tests
  - mocha?
  - jest (seems cooler)

- jest
  - need some sort of babely thing to transpile first
  - maybe just try mocha?
  - so need babel

- tried "start" task runner
  - no idea what's going on - it keeps trying to open a windows "how do you want to run this?" rather than node
  	- maybe the script is wrong? have to run it with "node >>>>"
  - but the idea is cool
- uninstalled "start"


--webpack 2
 - treeshaking?
 - +babel
 - +mocha
